# Disclaimer

This repository hosts the code for the **TutorGalaxy** service, originally designed as a backend for [TutorGalaxy.com](https://tutor-galaxy.com). Over time, I will refine and organize the code and the README to make it more user-friendly and adaptable as a package for broader use.

# What is tutor galaxy?
Tutor Galaxy is a personal tutoring service, and its key differentiator from **ChatGPT** is its ability to create and stick to a long-term learning plan for the user. Unlike ChatGPT, which is more focused on short-term interactions, Tutor Galaxy is designed to stay committed to the user's learning plan over time. It has been observed that ChatGPT, even when attempting to plan for a user, tends to deviate from the plan as the conversation progresses. In the following section, we will dive deeper into how Tutor Galaxy addresses the challenge of maintaining commitment to long-term plans.

# Tutor Initialization Module

To understand the user's expectations, the system starts a conversation to extract the main features the tutor should have from the user's point of view. The primary features the system aims to extract are:

- The topic that the tutor should discuss with the user.
- Whether the tutor should only answer questions or also plan and teach the course to the user.
- The character or personality of the tutor.
